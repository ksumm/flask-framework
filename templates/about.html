<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
    when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
    to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            Thorin Oakenshield
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon
            Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
            Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield,
            he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also
            nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long
            nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            Óin
        </h3>
        <p>
            He succeeded his father as king in TA 2385. He was also an ancestor to Balin the friend of Bilbo Baggins
            and
            Gimli the
            Elf-friend.

            Óin's reign was largely uneventful while he and his people lived in the Grey Mountains. In the final
            years
            of his reign,
            Sauron returned to Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and his shadow spread. As well, the Orcs of the Misty
            Mountains
            multiplied,
            plundering Moria and occupying it for hundreds of years.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin, son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain
            in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the
            Ring.

            Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of
            the

            the Council of Elrond.

            Balin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
            Dwarves
            who
            accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
            A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
            friends
            and advisers.
            Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

            He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
            more
            by Orcs, and
            he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
